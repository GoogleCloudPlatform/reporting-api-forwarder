# OpenTelemetry Collector for Reporting API Forwarder

This demo uses [OpenTelemetry contrib collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) that bundles [Google Cloud Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/googlecloudexporter).

You can modify the sample `config.yaml` to meet your backend. In such a case, you will also need to find or build OpenTelemetry Collector that bundles the exporter to your backend monitoring products. For details, please refer to [this blog post](https://medium.com/opentelemetry/building-your-own-opentelemetry-collector-distribution-42337e994b63).
## Setup

The [README of Google Cloud Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/googlecloudexporter) gives the detailed set up process. Please follow step 1, 2 and 3 in the README in advance of the following steps.

This section explains the specific setup process for this demo.

### Change the permission of the credential files

After obtaining the application default credentials in step 3 of the `googlecloudexporter` setting, you need to change the file permission so that Docker Compose can look up the file.

**NOTE: This operation is only for the demonstration purpose. Do not apply this to your production environment. Also, please remove the permission after trying this demo.**

```
chmod a+r ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json
```

### Install Docker Compose

_You can ignore this section if you already have Docker Compose on your environment._

This demo requires [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). If you don't have Docker Compose on your environment, please follow [the official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


### Run Docker Compose

After the setup, try running Docker Compose. You will see something like the followings:

```
$ cd ${PROJECT_ROOT}
$ docker-compose up
Starting reporting-api-forwarder_forwarder_1 ... done
Starting reporting-api-forwarder_collector_1 ... done
Attaching to reporting-api-forwarder_forwarder_1, reporting-api-forwarder_collector_1

collector_1  | 2021-09-05T04:48:20.950Z info    service/collector.go:218        Everything is ready. Begin running and processing data.
```

### Integration check

See the rest in [README](../README.md) in the project root.


## For local testing with Prometheus

In addition to the console exporter, this sample contains Prometheus configurations as well for local testing.
So that the collector can communicate with Prometheus, you need to uncomment the configurations for Prometheus in `${PROJECT_ROOT}/collector/config.yaml`

After uncommenting the section in the YAML file, you will see something like the followings:

```yaml
...(omit)...
## Uncomment prometheus section if you want to try locally
  prometheus:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:9990
    namespace: reporting-api-demo
    send_timestamps: true
    metric_expiration: 180m
...(omit)...
```

This configuration enables the OpenTelemetry Collector to expose Reporting API related metrics via port 9990.

So that the Prometheus server can communicate this OpenTelmetry Collector, you need to configure `${PROJECT_ROOT}/docker-compose.yaml` as well. See the details in the proejct root [README](../README.md).
