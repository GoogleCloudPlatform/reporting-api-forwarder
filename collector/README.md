# OpenTelemetry Collector for Reporting API Forwarder

This demo uses [OpenTelemetry contrib collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) that bundles [Google Cloud Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/googlecloudexporter).

You can modify the sample `config.yaml` to meet your backend. In such a case, you will also need to find or build OpenTelemetry Collector that bundles the exporter to your backend monitoring products. For details, please refer to [this blog post](https://medium.com/opentelemetry/building-your-own-opentelemetry-collector-distribution-42337e994b63).
## Setup

The [README of Google Cloud Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/googlecloudexporter) gives the detailed set up process. Please follow step 1, 2 and 3 in the README in advance of the following steps.

This section explains the specific setup process for this demo.

### Change the permission of the credential files

After obtaining the application default credentials in step 3 of the `googlecloudexporter` setting, you need to change the file permission so that Docker Compose can look up the file.

**NOTE: This operation is only for the demonstration purpose. Do not apply this to your production environment. Also, please remove the permission after trying this demo.**

```
chmod u+r ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json
```

### Install Docker Compose

_You can ignore this section if you already have Docker Compose on your environment._

This demo requires [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). If you don't have Docker Compose on your environment, please follow [the official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


### Run Docker Compose

After the setup, try running Docker Compose. You will see something like the followings:

```
$ cd ${PROJECT_ROOT}
$ docker-compose up
