# Reporting API forwarder

This is an unoffical Google project to demonstrate the [Reporting API](https://www.w3.org/TR/reporting/)'s endpoint server.
This server works as a web server that receives all data from Reporting API and forwards them to [Google Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring).
